### History

This history of distributed music precedes the smartphone by several decades. (For more on this, come to my [paper](media/history-audience-speaker.pdf) presentation on Thursday!)

In 1974, Jose Maceda's [Ugnayan]() is the first work identified with this genre of performance. He was able to broadcast a 1 hour multi-track *musique concrete* composition over approximately 30 radio stations in Manila, Philipines. The event was highly publicized and city-goers were encouraged to take their radios out into the street to realize the piece.

Maceda’s assistant Ramo ́n Santos notes how Maceda used the unique performance format as a compositional mechanism:

> Instead of reprocessing and reshaping these sounds electronically in a studio, Maceda utilized the human energies and the physical space of town plazas and parks to reprocess the sounds in semi-improvised dispersion schemes.

In other words, Maceda used distribution and participation, rather than the studio, as a means to compose musique concrete, to transform *objet sonores* into music.

We see this model in many other distributed music performances over the past 2 decades, including Golan Levin's *Dialtones: A Telesymphony* (2001). The composers installed custom ringtones on the audience's phones, and gave them precise seating locations, giving the composers control over both harmonic and spatial aspects.

There have been many more performances in this model since 2001 — check the paper!



### How Javascript Enables Distributed Music

Contemporary developments in Javascript enable distributed music, and have led to its proliferation.

- Web Audio API: Web audio, a full-featured synthesis engine in the browser, allows websites to become distributed music instruments. This makes for much quicker setup. 

  - In addition to WebPD, you might want to check out the Web Audio API and/or Tone.js.

- Socket.io:

  ​

Javascript has really expanded from its original use as an interaction engine, to a language that encompasses interface, communication, and sound — all the elements needed to create a distributed performance.

# NexusUI

NexusUI is a set of musical interface components written in HTML and Javascript. They will be the interface engine for our distributed music instruments.

A full tutorial on NexusUI is in the [NexusUI API](). 

Here are the basics --

### Creating an interface



### Configuring the interface



### Listening for its events
