# Standalone Web Instrument Template

This is an example of a standalone musical instrument in the browser, using WebPD (sound) and NexusUI (interface). This folder contains all the files needed to get started developing your own browser-based musical instrument.


Instructions
--------------

- open terminal and cd to this directory
- start the server:`rhizome config.js` 
- open a browser and go to localhost:8000



*Note: This example does not make use of rhizome, except to host the files. Therefore, rhizome is not strictly required here. You could take the contents of the /pages folder and host them on another server such as Mac's built-in Apache server, python http server, etc.*
